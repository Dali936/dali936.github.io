I am currently a third-year master student at Shenzhen University. I spent years at [VCC](https://vcc.tech/index) and [GM lab](https://www.gml.ac.cn/) focusing on point cloud analysis, and served as an intern at [Intellidust](https://github.com/Intellindust-AI-Lab/) under the supervision of [Xi Shen](https://xishen0220.github.io/), working on human mesh and skeleton recovery.

My research interests include human modeling, human motion generation, and human–scene interaction, with a broader focus on 3D vision and end-to-end scene reconstruction.

I am deeply interested in extending these capabilities toward virtual and augmented reality systems, envisioning immersive digital worlds similar to the OASIS in *Ready Player One* and Free City in *Free Guy*.
